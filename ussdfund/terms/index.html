                                trades’ stakes or number of winning trades. The onus is on the customer to stay within
                                the stated limits. Once a customer’s account balance exceeds the maximum account size,
                                then withdrawals must be made to bring the balance to within the limits.

                                information sourced through independent price providers, relevant exchanges, and
                                interbank authorities who supply liquidity and information to the global financial,
                                forex and/or futures markets. The current market price we display represents our
                                objective view of the prices available to arm’s length traders at the relevant time. In
                                order to ascertain and calculate current fair market prices the Company accesses a
                                number of different data sources and is required to take a number of factors into

                                settled using the current market price as displayed by the Company at the relevant time.
                                The company’s pricing on all available assets is fully transparent and the complete
                                price history for all assets is made available to all customers using the Tick by Tick

                                <br><b>11.</b> Strategy: The stakes for each trade are subtracted from the customer’s
                                account at the time the customer places the trade. The earnings for each winning trade
                                are credited to the customer’s account following the trade’s expiry. The strike price
                                given for each trade is according to the official price quote indicated by the Company
                                (“the Offered Price”) and is recorded according to the Offered Price as exists at the
                                time the trade is recorded on our Transactions Server. The expiry price given for each
                                trade is according to the official price quote indicated by the Company at the time of
                                the trade expiry. For assets which have both an ask and bid price quote, the mean price
                                is used and is determined by (Ask+Bid)/2 = Mean Price.
                                <br><b>12.</b> Profit calculation: We offer up to 90% profit on successful trades.
                                Variable profit rates apply. Profit rates are in flux and can change rapidly. The
                                available profit ranges from 70% to 90%. At the highest rate 90%, this is a 190% total
                                return on your trade inclusive of the trade stakes returned plus the profit rate. The
                                governing profit rate on a trade is the rate shown at the time the trade is recorded on

                                <br><b>13.</b> Expiry lockout: Trading is unavailable within the relevant lockout period
                                prior to expiry. The lockout period for each expiry is indicated by the clock on the
                                chart when the expiry is selected. Once the lockout time for a given expiry is reached,
                                a trade recorded after this time will be registered for the next expiry of that kind.
                                Any trade which is filled by our Transaction Server following the lockout period will
                                automatically carry over and be filled for the following expiry of that kind. Placing a
                                trade very close to the lockout will run the risk of the trade being filled for the
                                following expiry. We also offer Countdown expiries of 60 seconds, 120 seconds and 300
