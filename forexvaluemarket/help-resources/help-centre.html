                                        This is one of the most frequently asked questions. The difficult part in understanding ECN and STP meanings is that those have been interpreted differently by many people. There are three main business models used by Forex brokers which differ by the way the transactions are handled and orders are executed: ECN, STP and Market Makers.<br><br>ECN: ECN stands for 'Electronic Communication Network' which is simply a technical term that is used to describe how banks and liquidity providers connect to each other to form a bid and offer price. In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client, a liquidity provider or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution that may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider processes all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider, this price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed, hence it is known as STP.<br><br>Forex Value Market is the issuer of the products it provides. We consider ourselves to be a forex provider offering the ECN pricing model as we source our pricing from external unrelated liquidity providers , these prices are passed onto you with no dealing desk intervention. In order to provide you with better price certainty and to ensure fast execution speed we do not offset each and every position with our liquidity providers. We do this in order to provide you with a better overall trading experience.<br>&nbsp;

                                                            Forex brokers use three main business models which differ in the way the transactions are handled and orders are executed: ECN, STP and Market Makers.<br><br>ECN: ECN stands for 'Electronic Communication Network', which is simply a technical term that is used to describe how banks and liquidity providers connect to each other to form bid and offer prices. In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client or liquidity provider, or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution, which may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider process all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider. This price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed; hence, it is known as STP.<br><br>Forex Value Market is the issuer of the products it provides. We consider ourselves to be a Forex provider offering the ECN pricing model as we source our pricing from external unrelated liquidity providers. These prices are passed on to you with no dealing desk intervention. In order to provide you with better price certainty and to ensure fast execution speed, we do not hedge each and every position with our liquidity providers. We do this in order to provide you with a better overall trading experience.

The source of the underlying market price may vary for each product.<br><br>Although Forex Value Market's prices come from its liquidity providers and Forex Value Market is not practically involved in the making of the price, simply streaming prices which it receives, the prices nonetheless become Forex Value Market's prices when it provides them to its clients to trade on. This is the case for all derivative products which Forex Value Market offers to its clients.

We are not a broker to you but a product issuer. Simply put, we act as a principal to your trades and are the sole counterparty that allows you to access prices streamed from our liquidity providers that supply Forex Value Market with the pricing.<br><br>Technically, when you buy a product at Forex Value Market, we are selling that product to you. It may not be possible for you to buy that product on an exchange or from a bank directly.<br><br>Typically, market makers are considered to be Forex and CFD providers who operate a dealing desk in order to create their own prices. These prices can be based on their own proprietary trading positions or overall risk exposure and may not reflect the prices in the underlying market.

                                                            Triple swap rates are charged on Wednesday. The reason for this is that spot Forex contracts have a two-day settlement period. For example, a spot Forex contract that occurred on Monday settles on Wednesday, a trade that occurred on Tuesday settles on Thursday, a trade that occurred on Wednesday settles on Friday, but a trade that occurred on Thursday settles on the following Monday. In this example, the trade that occurred on Thursday rolled through the weekend because the banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Triple rollover interest is applied to positions held open at 5pm New York time on Wednesday as this time marks the beginning of the new 24-hour trading day (Thursday). <br><br>You should note that swap rates can be negative or positive, depending on the currency pair traded and the prevailing interest rates at that time.

                                                            A dividend adjustment is applied to a share or index CFD position in the event of a dividend payment occurring in the underlying share or share constituent of an index. The ex-dividend date is the day a stock starts trading without its dividend payment. In the case of an index, an adjustment will be made that is equal to the number of points by which the index price must be adjusted downwards to take account of those shares in the index which go ex-dividend at the close of the cash market. The ex-dividend figure estimated by Bloomberg, rounded to the tick size we use for that index, is used to determine what adjustment to apply. In the case of long positions, the dividend adjustment is in the form a trading account credit. In the case of short positions, the dividend adjustment is in the form of a trading account debit.

You must refer to the bid prices to check whether the requested take profit price level on a buy trade has been reached or not. However, in the case of a sell trade, you must refer to the ask prices. It is also important to note that a standard account has one pip mark-up on the raw spreads. This spread mark-up does not appear in bid prices recorded on the chart by default.<br>

                                                            Forex, or the 'Foreign Exchange Market', is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily average turnover of approximately US$3 trillion. Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. The price of currencies is floating and dependent on supply and demand. Foreign exchange is always traded in pairs, for example EUR/USD or AUD/USD.

                                                            Making money trading Forex involves buying lower and selling higher or selling higher and buying back lower. Using leverage means that you are able to deposit a smaller amount of money to achieve the same buying power as you would have if you bought and sold the currencies outright.<br><br>In this example, Mary deposits $5,000 into her Forex trading account and nominates the leverage on her account to be 1:100. As a result of leverage, Mary’s buying power on her $5,000 deposit becomes $500,000. Mary decides to buy 0.1 lots of the AUD/USD par at a price of 0.99802. Three days later, the price of the AUD/USD is 1.04069 and Mary decides to close her position. Mary’s profit is calculated as (1.04069 – 0.99802) 426 pips. As Mary opened a position of 0.1 lots, she made a profit of $426, or $1 per pip.<br><br>Of course, should the AUD/USD have moved against Mary below the opening price of her trade to a level of 0.97802, Mary would have incurred a loss on the trade of (0.99802 – 0.95542) 426 pips. As Mary’s position size was 0.1 lots, she would have incurred a loss of $426 or $1 per pip.<br><br>It is important to be aware that when trading Forex you can also incur losses which can be greater than your initial deposit.

This is mainly because of the large number of market participants and sheer size and number of transactions. No one single country or bank can completely control the direction of a currency.

The most notable influences include interest rates, inflation and political stability. Sometimes, governments will buy or sell a currency in an effort to influence its value with a view to having a broader effect on the country’s economy. This is known as ‘central bank intervention’ and can have a significant impact on the value of a currency. Given the size and diversity of participants, no one single factor can influence the Forex market for any significant length of time.

The most common form of risk management is the use of stop loss and limit orders. Stop loss orders can be set within the MetaTrader 4 platform and are often used to force the closure of a position at a predetermined price in order to limit any potential loss. Limit orders work in much the same way as stop loss orders; however, they allow a restriction to be placed on the maximum price paid.

Some traders choose to use fundamental analysis, which revolves around interpreting economic information including news, government reports and sometimes even rumour. Often, however, it is elements outside of technical and fundamental analysis that have the most dramatic effect on currency prices. This includes events such as central bank intervention, interest rate changes, political change or even war.

Traders can now trade on institutional grade pricing with a deposit of as little as $200 and leverage of up to 500:1. It is, however, important to remember that although trading on leverage can maximise profits, it can also amplify losses.

Triple swap rates are charged in the rollover period on Wednesday night to account for the settlement of trades over the weekend, during which no swap rates are charged due to the market being closed.

Identify whether the file is archived or in its normal format. To perform this check, right-click on the file and select ‘Properties’. At the top, it will say if it is a MetaQuotes Language 4 file. If it is not, it is most likely an archive. If the file is archived or zipped, make sure to unzip the file.<br><br>Now, open your MetaTrader 4 platform. At the menu bar, click ‘File’ and navigate to ‘Open Data Folder’. Double click the ‘MQL4’ folder and open the ‘Experts’ folder. Now go back to where you have downloaded your EA and drag it into the open ‘Experts’ folder.<br><br>Once done, close all windows. Restart MetaTrader 4 platform and the EA should appear in your ‘Navigator’ panel.

                                                            As you are trading leveraged CFD products, you will be able to open positions that are larger than your account balance. This means that a smaller move in your favour will result in a larger profit and a smaller move against you will result in a large loss. If the price of the CFD you are trading gaps or moves against you quickly, it is possible that you could lose more than your account balance.<br><br>Although we will attempt to close your position when the margin level falls to 50% of the required margin (stop out level), we cannot guarantee that your account will not enter into a negative balance. You will be in margin call when the margin level drops to 100% of the required margin; at this point, you will see the position change colour in your trading platform. This is an indication to take appropriate measures by either reducing the exposure or adding additional funds to the trading account. If the margin level drops a further 50%, the platform will automatically start closing out positions.

MetaTrader 4 was built by Metaquotes, has been around for the longest and remains the most popular amongst traders while cTrader is relatively new in comparison and has several features that do not exist on other platforms. MetaTrader 5 is a newer version of MetaTrader 4 but is yet to become popular. Each of the trading platforms we offer is different and we recommend that you try demos of all of them to see which one best suits your trading style. The user interface, advanced take profit and stop loss systems, detachable charts, varying chart time frames, live sentiment and depth of market displayed by default are among the key differences. There is also a vast range of custom indicators and EA readily available for MetaTrader4.<br>

                                                            In currency trading, ‘gapping’ typically occurs when the currency reopens for trading after a weekend/rollover. Gaps are usually caused by low liquidity in the market. It is possible to retrieve the missing data by refreshing the chart if the gap has occurred because the chart has not updated correctly.

                                                            cTrader is a moderately new retail trading platform as compared to the MetaQuotes' MetaTrader 4 platform. A few of the key differences include the user interface, advanced take profit, advanced stop-loss, detachable charts, variable chart time frames, live sentiments and depth of market. The ability to choose preferences while displaying volume as units or lot sizes, as well as onscreen calculations, are also included in cTrader.<br><br>Having said that, MetaTrader 4 is a much older platform and it has a great deal of support, with features available online and through the MetaQuotes forum. There is also a vast range of custom indicators and EA that are readily available for MetaTrader4.

To minimize the risk of freezing, it is advisable to use the fastest possible internet connection with the highest possible hardware specifications. Hosting your platform on a VPS instead of your local hard drive would also minimize such occurrences.

                                                            ‘Margin’ is the amount of money required in your account in order to open a position. Margin is calculated based on the current price of the base currency against USD, the size (volume) of the position and the leverage applied to your trading account. If you do not have sufficient free equity available, you will be unable to open a position on the trading platform. The free margin amount shown in the trading platform is the amount you have available to use should you wish to open additional positions.<br><br>Margin is calculated using the following formula:<br><br>Margin required = (current market price x volume) / Account leverage<br><br>In practice, this would be calculated as follows:<br>If you open a position of 0.1 (10000) in EUR/USD at the current market price of 1.35645 and your account has a leverage of 1:400, you would calculate the margin required as follows:<br>(1.35645 x 10000) / 400 = $33.91<br><br>In this example, the margin on this position would be $33.91; therefore, in order to open a position of this size you would require at least $33.91 in free margin in your trading account.

This logic will replace cTrader’s Fair Stop Out logic because it provides significant benefits for users by using a much more advanced algorithm.<br><br>If margin level falls below Smart Stop Out level, then positions will start being partially closed until margin level reaches above the Smart Stop Out. The logic of Smart Stop Out will only close what is absolutely necessary from the largest position in order to safely restore margin level and protect the position itself, the position entry point and the trading account for as long as possible.<br><br>For more information, see <a id='a56' href="#/forex-trading-platform-ctrader/smart-stop-out">cTrader Smart Stop Out</a> page.

If on the other hand you sell 1 standard lot of 100,000 units of AUD against USD you are entering into a ‘short’ position.

                                                            Both our MetaTrader 4 and cTrader platforms are set to automatically close your positions when your margin requirement reaches 100% (stop out level). This process is automated and is not a guarantee that your account will not enter into a negative equity situation. We recommend that you always maintain a balance in your account over and above your required margin. If the stop level is reached, a market order is triggered to close your open positions at the next available price in the market.<br><br>Events such as markets gapping over the weekend or on major holidays, where liquidity is thin, can increase the chance of your positions being stopped out and a negative equity situation occurring. We advise that you use stop loss orders to limit your risk and monitor the margin level in your account regularly. You will be responsible for any negative balance in your trading account.

                                                            Slippage is an inherent part of financial markets. Whether you are trading Stocks, Futures, CFDs on Commodities or Forex, you will be subject to slippage. When you place a market order, you are requesting your order is filled at the current market prices; however, if the market has moved between the time you place your order and the time it has been filled, your order may be filled at a different price. Slippage can increase when markets become volatile, such as over new releases. You should keep this in mind when trading outside of normal market conditions.<br><br>Stop loss orders, when triggered, enter the market as market orders; therefore, there is no guarantee that your order will be filled at the price you placed your stop loss.

You can, however, draw an 'Ask' line on the charts by clicking on the chart and selecting 'show ask line'. This will result in an estimation of the 'Ask' price, which is based entirely on the spread. You should bear this in mind when conducting any historical analysis using the charts available in MetaTrader 4.

                                                            A trailing stop is a type of stop loss order attached to a trade that moves as the price fluctuates. It is designed to lock in profits or limit losses as a trade moves favourably by a certain amount of pips, as set by the investor. It is important to note that trailing stops only move if the price moves favourably. Once it moves to lock in a profit or reduce a loss, it does not move back the other way.

On the MetaTrader4/MetaTrader 5 platform, if the account is perfectly hedged and does not require any margin, the positions will remain open. However, in the case of the cTrader platform, the margin is required for the direction carrying the higher volume and margin requirements, irrespective of whether the overall position of the account is perfectly hedged.<br><br>Please note that different hedge margin level and settings may be applied to different products and platforms. The option to hedge a position while in negative Free Margin may not be available across our full product offering. We suggest you make yourself fully aware of the product specifications of the instruments you are trading or intend to trade. We recommend establishing a demo account to familiarise yourself with the Hedging Mechanics and associated risks. <br><br> For further clarification, please contact our support team.

When a Futures CFD contract expires, all the open positions are closed at the Futures settlement price as reported by the Futures exchange.<br><br>This process usually takes place on the day following the expiry. Open positions are not rolled to the next month, so any clients wishing to hold long-term positions must reopen the trade on the next available contract.

                                                            Typically, if a withdrawal request is received before 01:00 GMetaTrader (12:00 AEST) it will be processed on the day of receipt. If your withdrawal request is received after this time, it will be processed on the following business day. Once we have processed your withdrawal request, you should allow at least 3 business days for the funds to reach you. This will vary depending on the withdrawal method used. Usually, withdrawals processed using Paypal or credit card are much faster than wire transfer.

                                                            Typically, a failed deposit occurs as a result of insufficient funds in the depositing source (e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc), an incompatible card (e.g. American Express), restrictions applied by your financial banking institution or the incorrect card details being used. Should a deposit fail after all of the above have been checked, we recommend you contact the financial institution you are attempting to transfer funds from.

This will remove your account from the page and place it in the hidden accounts section.

Foreign exchange is always traded in pairs, for example EUR/USD or AUD/USD."},{"o":0,"id":"i_28","ip":"#i_28","q":"How is a profit or loss incurred when trading Forex?","a":"Making money trading Forex involves buying lower and selling higher or selling higher and buying back lower. Using leverage means that you are able to deposit a smaller amount of money to achieve the same buying power as you would have if you bought and sold the currencies outright.<br><br>In this example, Mary deposits $5,000 into her Forex trading account and nominates the leverage on her account to be 1:100. As a result of leverage, Mary’s buying power on her $5,000 deposit becomes $500,000. Mary decides to buy 0.1 lots of the AUD/USD par at a price of 0.99802. Three days later, the price of the AUD/USD is 1.04069 and Mary decides to close her position. Mary’s profit is calculated as (1.04069 – 0.99802) 426 pips. As Mary opened a position of 0.1 lots, she made a profit of $426, or $1 per pip.<br><br>Of course, should the AUD/USD have moved against Mary below the opening price of her trade to a level of 0.97802, Mary would have incurred a loss on the trade of (0.99802 – 0.95542) 426 pips. As Mary’s position size was 0.1 lots, she would have incurred a loss of $426 or $1 per pip.<br><br>It is important to be aware that when trading Forex you can also incur losses which can be greater than your initial deposit."},{"o":0,"id":"i_29","ip":"#i_29","q":"Is the Forex market a fair market?","a":"Forex is said to be one of the fairest and most transparent markets on earth.

The Forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, it opens in New Zealand and closes in New York."},{"o":0,"id":"i_31","ip":"#i_31","q":"Who are the main participants in the Forex market?","a":"The main participants in the Forex market are central banks, commercial banks and investment banks, however, in recent years - since the advent of the internet - accessibility to the Forex market has increased, which has resulted in an increase in the number of non-bank participants.

The most commonly traded pairs are the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CHF and USD/CAD."},{"o":0,"id":"i_34","ip":"#i_34","q":"What makes exchange rates move?","a":"A variety of fundamental and technical aspects can cause an exchange rate to move. The most notable influences include interest rates, inflation and political stability. Sometimes, governments will buy or sell a currency in an effort to influence its value with a view to having a broader effect on the country’s economy. This is known as ‘central bank intervention’ and can have a significant impact on the value of a currency. Given the size and diversity of participants, no one single factor can influence the Forex market for any significant length of time."},{"o":0,"id":"i_35","ip":"#i_35","q":"How do I manage risk when trading Forex?","a":"Forex traders can use a variety of risk management strategies. The most common form of risk management is the use of stop loss and limit orders. Stop loss orders can be set within the MetaTrader 4 platform and are often used to force the closure of a position at a predetermined price in order to limit any potential loss.

Nowadays, technical trading is becoming increasingly popular and traders are using a variety of technical indicators, such as trend lines, support and resistance levels, and numerous other methods, to identify short-to-medium term trading opportunities. Some traders choose to use fundamental analysis, which revolves around interpreting economic information including news, government reports and sometimes even rumour.

This includes events such as central bank intervention, interest rate changes, political change or even war."},{"o":0,"id":"i_37","ip":"#i_37","q":"Is trading the Forex market expensive?","a":"No, trading Forex has never been cheaper or more accessible.

If you do not have sufficient free equity available, you will be unable to open a position on the trading platform. The free margin amount shown in the trading platform is the amount you have available to use should you wish to open additional positions.<br><br>Margin is calculated using the following formula:<br><br>Margin required = (current market price x volume) / Account leverage<br><br>In practice, this would be calculated as follows:<br>If you open a position of 0.1 (10000) in EUR/USD at the current market price of 1.35645 and your account has a leverage of 1:400, you would calculate the margin required as follows:<br>(1.35645 x 10000) / 400 = $33.91<br><br>In this example, the margin on this position would be $33.91; therefore, in order to open a position of this size you would require at least $33.91 in free margin in your trading account."},{"o":0,"id":"i_51","ip":"#i_51","q":"Can I set pending orders in MetaTrader 4?","a":"MetaTrader 4 allows pending orders to be set.

In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and your trades will be offset with another client or liquidity provider, or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. This is distinct from order execution, which may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.<br><br>STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider process all trades at market prices obtained from a liquidity provider. This price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed; hence, it is known as STP.<br><br>Forex Value Market is the issuer of the products it provides. We consider ourselves to be a Forex provider offering the ECN pricing model as we source our pricing from external unrelated liquidity providers.

In this example, the trade that occurred on Thursday rolled through the weekend because the banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Triple rollover interest is applied to positions held open at 5pm New York time on Wednesday as this time marks the beginning of the new 24-hour trading day (Thursday). <br><br>You should note that swap rates can be negative or positive, depending on the currency pair traded and the prevailing interest rates at that time."},{"o":0,"id":"i_149","ip":"#i_149","q":"How many Stocks CFDs do you offer?","a":"Forex Value Market offers over +2100 Stocks CFDs.
