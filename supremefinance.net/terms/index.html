                                            1. The trade name is owned and operated under regulated authority.<br>
                                            2. The Company does not provide a market or exchange amongst or between
                                            customers for trades, securities, derivatives, options, or market
                                            speculations. Each trade placed by a customer is an individual skill-based
                                            game between the customer and the Company and is not a trade, security,
                                            derivative, option, or market speculation, nor is it transferable,
                                            negotiable or assignable to or with any third party. Actual exchange traded
                                            binary options also exist and are fundamentally different to the offerings
                                            available to customers via this site. On an actual options exchange
                                            participants trade against other participants over the exchange. This site
                                            is not an options nor futures exchange which are regulated differently, by
                                            regulators who oversee dealings and dealers in tradable financial
                                            instruments, financial markets, options and/or futures as well as the
                                            exchanges over which such financial products are dealt. <br>
                                            3. Prices of a stock, commodity, currency or index can be highly volatile
                                            and difficult to predict. Due to such volatility, no trade placed within
                                            this site should be considered a safe bet. The services offered by this site
                                            are only suitable for customers who understand the risks involved and are
                                            able to bear the loss of all the money they stake. The maximum losses that
                                            may be incurred by any customer is limited to the amount of money paid by
                                            the customer to the Company. <br>
                                            4. Each customer will create a personal password which should be kept
                                            strictly confidential as all transactions where a customer’s email and
                                            password have been correctly entered will be regarded as valid, subject to
                                            meeting the criteria for placing trades laid down in these Terms and
                                            Conditions. You agree to be fully and personally liable for the due

                                            to your account. You are responsible for ensuring that you alone control
                                            access to the account, and that no minors are granted access to trading on
                                            this site. You remain fully liable for all trades and credit/debit card
                                            transactions entered for your account. You agree to indemnify the Company in
                                            respect to all costs and losses of any kind whatsoever as may be incurred by
                                            the Company as a result, direct or indirect, of your failure to perform or
                                            settle such transactions.<br>
                                            5. The Company will not be liable in any way to any customer in the event of
                                            force majeure, or for the act of any Government or legal authority, or for
                                            the failure of or damage or destruction to its computer systems, data or
                                            records or any part thereof, or for delays, losses, errors or omissions
                                            resulting from the failure or mismanagement of any telecommunications or
                                            computer equipment or software. The Company reserves the right to void any
                                            part or all of any trade or any event that is not completed (e.g. frozen,
                                            abandoned, and postponed). The Company may, at its sole discretion, suspend
                                            the relevant offerings on our site and cancel all trades relevant to any
                                            assets where: • the stock exchange or interbank authority suspends trading
                                            activities of any asset offered on this site, • a blatant error is made in
                                            transmission of any asset data, • the Company has reason to believe that a
                                            trade is placed after the outcome of an event is known or with reasonably
                                            foreseeable knowledge of the event which gives an undue advantage or
                                            superior position; • as a result of political, economic, military or
                                            monetary events (including unusual market volatility or liquidity) or any
                                            circumstances outside the control, responsibility or power of the Company,
                                            the continued operation of any offering on this site is not reasonably
                                            practicable without adversely affecting and prejudicing the interests of
                                            customers or the Company; or • there is a breakdown in the means of
                                            communication normally employed in determining the price or value of any of
                                            the assets or where the price or value of any of the assets cannot be
                                            promptly or accurately ascertained. In such event, the Company shall refund
                                            the stakes corresponding to any cancelled trades to the customer, and no
                                            further claim may be entertained against the Company in connection thereto.
                                            <br>
                                            6. The Company reserves the right at its sole discretion to refuse and/or
                                            cancel services to anyone for any reason including, without limitation, any
                                            instance where: • the customer’s activities at this site may be illegal in
                                            that person’s country or state; • the Company may be contacted by legal
                                            authorities or regulators from that person’s country or state; • the Company
                                            may suffer any pecuniary, fiscal or regulatory disadvantage by virtue of
                                            that person’s activities at this site; or • transactions on this site are
                                            performed in breach of the Terms and Conditions. <br>
                                            7. No person shall abuse this site for the purpose of money laundering. The
                                            Company employs best-practice anti-money laundering procedures, which can
                                            have several effects on customers. The Company reserves the right to refuse
                                            to do business with, to discontinue to do business with, and to reverse the
                                            transactions of, customers who do not accept or adhere to these anti-money
                                            laundering processes. Accounts may be frozen or closed if satisfactory
                                            customer due diligence documentation is not provided. The anti-money
                                            laundering processes have the following effects on customers: • You must
                                            fill into the account opening form all requested details that establish your
                                            identity. • The Company may, from time to time, at its sole discretion,
                                            require you to provide proof of identity (such as notarized copy of passport
                                            or other means of identity verification as the Company deems required under
                                            the circumstances) and may suspend an account until such proof has been
                                            provided to its satisfaction. • You agree that we may use the personal
                                            information you provide in order to conduct anti-fraud checks. Personal
                                            information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud
                                            prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. • Earnings
                                            payouts or withdrawals may only be paid to the initiator of an account. When
                                            a customer maintains an account by means of telegraphic deposits, earnings
                                            payouts or withdrawals are only paid to the holder of the originating bank
                                            account, and the onus is on the customer to ensure that account number and
                                            name accompany all transfers to the Company. When a customer maintains an
                                            account by means of credit/debit card deposits, earnings payouts or
                                            withdrawals are only paid back to the same card. • Only one account is
                                            allowed per person. No earnings payouts may be collected on accounts opened
                                            in false names or on multiple accounts opened by the same person. <br>
                                            8. The Company may impose trade volume and other limits on Customer accounts
                                            at its sole discretion. The current trade volume limit upon account opening
                                            is USD/GBP/EUR 25,000/day maximum trading volume. The maximum account size
                                            (i.e. cash balance) is USD/GBP/EUR 30,000. The maximum outstanding payout
                                            with respect to active trades at a given time per account is USD/GBP/EUR
                                            30,000. The maximum payout to any one customer with respect to any one day’s
                                            completed trades is USD/GBP/EUR 30,000. These limits are increased once a
                                            customer fully authenticates himself; where after the new maximum trading
                                            volume will be USD/GBP/EUR 250,000/day, having a maximum account size of
                                            USD/GBP/EUR 250,000, and a maximum outstanding payout for active trades at a
                                            given time per account of USD/GBP/EUR 250,000. Payouts for completed trades
                                            remain subject to the stated daily maximum payout to any one customer in any
                                            one day, irrespective of total trades’ stakes or number of winning trades.
                                            The onus is on the customer to stay within the stated limits. Once a
                                            customer’s account balance exceeds the maximum account size, then
                                            withdrawals must be made to bring the balance to within the limits. <br>
                                            9. Persons with insider knowledge of any financial market or instrument are
                                            prohibited from trading at this site. It is a condition of the Company’s
                                            acceptance of trades from you, and by your offering to place trades that you
                                            represent that: (a) you are not prohibited from placing the trade by any
                                            term of your contract of employment or any rule of a Financial Market
                                            Governing Body which applies to you; (b) you are not aware of any
                                            circumstances which would make the placing of the trade a breach of a rule
                                            applied by a Financial Market Governing Body; (c) when a trade is placed on
                                            the outcome of any event or process (“the event”) you do not possess
                                            advanced superior knowledge as to the outcome of the event or on the
                                            likelihood of anything occurring or not occurring; (d) you are the person
                                            whose details are provided in connection with your registration; and (e) you
                                            are not an undischarged bankrupt or in a voluntary arrangement with your
                                            creditors. In the event of any such representation by you proving to be
                                            false, your trade stakes will be forfeit and the Company shall not be
                                            obliged to make any payouts which might otherwise have been payable. <br>
                                            10. Asset pricing: All prices displayed on this site are based on official
                                            quotes from the relevant stock exchange or interbank authorities. The
                                            Company provides its customers with real-time streaming prices or quotes by
                                            collecting and aggregating information sourced through independent price
                                            providers, relevant exchanges, and interbank authorities who supply
                                            liquidity and information to the global financial, forex and/or futures
                                            markets. The current market price we display represents our objective view
                                            of the prices available to arm’s length traders at the relevant time. In
                                            order to ascertain and calculate current fair market prices the Company
                                            accesses a number of different data sources and is required to take a number
                                            of factors into account including volume weighting and market volatility.
                                            All trades are priced and settled using the current market price as
                                            displayed by the Company at the relevant time. The company’s pricing on all
                                            available assets is fully transparent and the complete price history for all
                                            assets is made available to all customers using the Tick by Tick Search
                                            function. <br>
                                            11. Strategy: The stakes for each trade are subtracted from the customer’s
                                            account at the time the customer places the trade. The earnings for each
                                            winning trade are credited to the customer’s account following the trade’s
                                            expiry. The strike price given for each trade is according to the official
                                            price quote indicated by the Company (“the Offered Price”) and is recorded
                                            according to the Offered Price as exists at the time the trade is recorded
                                            on our Transactions Server. The expiry price given for each trade is
                                            according to the official price quote indicated by the Company at the time
                                            of the trade expiry. For assets which have both an ask and bid price quote,
                                            the mean price is used and is determined by (Ask+Bid)/2 = Mean Price. <br>

                                            Variable profit rates apply. Profit rates are in flux and can change
                                            rapidly. The available profit ranges from 70% to 90%. At the highest rate
                                            90%, this is a 190% total return on your trade inclusive of the trade stakes
                                            returned plus the profit rate. The governing profit rate on a trade is the
                                            rate shown at the time the trade is recorded on our Transactions Server.

                                            13. Expiry lockout: Trading is unavailable within the relevant lockout
                                            period prior to expiry. The lockout period for each expiry is indicated by
                                            the clock on the chart when the expiry is selected. Once the lockout time
                                            for a given expiry is reached, a trade recorded after this time will be
                                            registered for the next expiry of that kind. Any trade which is filled by
                                            our Transaction Server following the lockout period will automatically carry
                                            over and be filled for the following expiry of that kind. Placing a trade
                                            very close to the lockout will run the risk of the trade being filled for
                                            the following expiry. We also offer Countdown expiries of 60 seconds, 120
                                            seconds and 300 seconds with no lockout. <br>
                                            14. Each trade successfully placed by the customer will be given an
                                            individual transaction confirmation number. Once a trade is placed, it
                                            cannot be cancelled. Trades will only be valid, subject to meeting the
                                            criteria for placing trades laid down in these Terms and Conditions, if
                                            accepted by our Transactions Server. The Company is not liable for the
                                            settlement of any trade where a transaction confirmation number is not
                                            issued and displayed in the customer’s ‘Account Journal’ page of this site.

                                            15. Our Transactions Server log governs with respect to all determinations
                                            of timing including the time at which a trade is placed, the applicable
                                            profit rate, strike price, and expiry price, irrespective of the time at
                                            which the customer may have attempted to place the trade or the time at
                                            which the stock exchange or interbank authorities published prices. In the
                                            event of a query, it is your responsibility to be notified at the earliest
                                            opportunity. Any queries relating to a trade must be raised no later than
                                            twelve hours after the trade has been settled. The Company cannot guarantee
                                            that it will be able to respond to any query which is not raised within this
                                            time. Our real-time streaming price data governs with respect to any issues
                                            involving the pricing or settlement of trades irrespective of any differing
                                            price information which might be displayed by third party data providers.
                                            With respect to any issues as to times, prices, and trade settlements, the
                                            decision of the Company shall be final and binding. <br>
                                            16. The Company reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and to void
                                            any trades placed where such have occurred. In the event that any trade’s
                                            pricing grossly deviates from fair market prices due to an undetected
                                            programming error, bug or glitch in our software, the Company reserves the
                                            right to cancel or reverse such transactions upon notification to the
                                            customer of the nature of the computer error that led to the mis-pricing. In
                                            such event, the Company shall refund to the customer the stakes
                                            corresponding to any cancelled trades, and no further claim may be
                                            entertained against the Company in connection thereto. Customers have a duty
                                            to report to the Company any problems or suspected system inadequacies that
                                            they may experience including without limitation extrinsic information
                                            providing asset data ahead of the Company’s and customers may not abuse
                                            system problems or inadequacies for profit. The Company will endeavor to
                                            resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible. <br>
