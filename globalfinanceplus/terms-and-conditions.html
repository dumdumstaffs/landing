                                of Business and Account Opening Agreement as amended.</p>

                                transaction, the Execution Venue reserves the right to amend or call off the details of

                            <p><strong>Market Making</strong></p>
                            <p>6.1 The client is particularly made aware of the fact, that in certain markets, including
                                the foreign exchange markets, OTC foreign exchange options and CFD Contracts, the
                                company will act only as an ECN broker.</p>
                            <p>6.2 Global Finance Plus will not act as the Execution Venue.</p>
                            <p>6.3 When acting as an ECN broker, Global Finance Plus will not establish bid and ask
                                prices.</p>
                            <p>6.4 In order for Global Finance Plus, to quote prices with the quickness normally
                                associated with speculative trading, Global Finance Plus may have to rely on available
                                information that may later prove to be erroneous, due to specific market circumstances
                                (e.g. lack of liquidity , suspension of an asset or errors in feeds from information
                                providers or quotes from Counterparties) If this occurs and if Global Finance Plus has
                                acted in good faith when providing the price to the client, Global Finance Plus may
                                revoke the trade with the client but must do so within reasonable time frame and shall
                                provide the client with a full explanation of such cancellation.</p>
                            <p>6.5 Following execution of any position with a client, the Execution Venue may afterwards
                                compensate each such client position with another client position, or a position with
                                one of the Execution Venue&rsquo;s Counterparties or maintain a proprietary position in
                                the market, to obtain profits from such positions. Such decisions and actions may result
                                in the Execution Venue offsetting client positions at prices, sometimes significantly
                                different, from prices stated to clients, resulting in trading profits or losses for the
                                Execution Venue.</p>
                            <p>This can consequently create what may be seen as an implied cost (i.e. the difference
                                between the price at which the client traded with the Execution Venue and the price at
                                which the Execution Venue subsequently traded with Counterparties and/or other clients).
                                The Market Making function may pose significant costs to the Execution Venue if the
                                market moves against it as compared to the price at which it traded with the client.</p>
                            <p>6.6 The client acknowledges that the Execution Venue in CFD contracts where it acts as
                                Market Maker, may hold positions that are contrary to positions of the client, resulting
                                in potential conflicts of interest between the Execution Venue and the client.</p>
                            <p>6.7 In markets, where the Execution Venue acts as a Market Maker, the client accepts that
                                Global Finance Plus has no obligation to state prices to clients at all times in any
                                given market, nor to quote such prices to clients included the specific maximum spread.
                            </p>
                            <p>6.8 The client understands, recognizes and accepts that the price quoted to the client
                                includes a spread, when compared with the price to which the Execution Venue may have
                                covered or expected to be able to cover the Contract in a trade with another client or a
                                counter party.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the client acknowledges and accepts that this spread represents Global Finance
                                Plus remuneration and that such spread cannot automatically be calculated for all
                                Contracts and that such spread will not be described at the Trade Confirmation or
                                otherwise disclosed to the client.</p>
                            <p>6.9 Any commissions, interest charges, costs associated to and included in the spreads
                                quoted by the Execution Venue as a Market Maker in certain markets and other fees will
                                therefore have influence on the client&rsquo;s trading result and will have a negative
                                effect on the client&rsquo;s trading performance, compared to a situation in such the
                                commissions, interest charges and costs associated to and included in the spreads, did
                                not apply.</p>
                            <p>6.10 a) In the case that the client account equity is equal or exceeds 300,000 USD (or
                                currency equivalent) and there are open trades of Metals (Gold and/or Silver) of 50 lots
                                or more, Global Finance Plus has the right to adjust the leverage of the underlying
                                trading account to 1:75. If this occurs, Global Finance Plus will notify the client by
                                email.</p>
                            <p>b) If the client is an active trader and is executing numerous transactions, the total
                                effect of visible as well as not visible costs may be important. The client may have to
                                achieve significant profits in the markets to be able cover the costs associated with
                                trading activities with the Execution Venue. For very active clients, these costs may
                                even surpass the value of the margin deposited. Normally, when trading margined
                                derivatives, the lower the percentage of the applicable margin rate, the higher the
                                proportion of the costs associated with executing a transaction. Margined derivatives
                                are derivatives such as CFD&rsquo;s that can be traded using a leverage of higher than
                                1:1.</p>
                            <p>6.11 The client is particularly informed, that in trading of OTC foreign exchange
                                options, CFD Contracts and other OTC products, implied charges may arise as an
                                after-effect of the profits made by the Execution Venue performing in its capacity as a
                                Market Maker.</p>
                            <p>6.12 The Execution Venue is at no time obliged to reveal any details of its performance
                                or income produced as a Market Maker or otherwise, related to other commissions, charges
                                and fees.</p>
                            <p>6.13 The client is made aware that CFD Contracts may be OTC products quoted by the
                                Execution Venue whilst operating as a Market Maker and not traded on a recognized stock
                                exchange. As a result, non-visible costs related to the Execution Venue performance as a
                                Market Maker may also apply to any CFD Contract.</p>
                            <p><strong>Arbitrage</strong></p>
                            <p>7.1 Internet, connectivity delays, and price feed errors sometimes create a situation
                                where the price displayed on the Trading Platform does not reflect the market rates
                                precisely. In the OTC market, where the client is buying or selling directly from the
                                principal, cannot exist the concept of arbitrage and Global Finance Plus does not permit
                                the practice of arbitrage on the Trading Platform. Transactions, depending on price
                                latency arbitrage opportunities may be dismissed without prior notice.</p>
                            <p>Global Finance Plus reserves the right to make the necessary corrections or modifications
                                on the Account involved, without prior notice. Accounts that rely on arbitrage
                                strategies may be subject to Global Finance Plus&rsquo; intervention and Global Finance
                                Plus&rsquo; approval of any Orders. Any conflict arising from such quoting or execution
                                errors will be solved by Global Finance Plus in their absolute discretion.</p>
                            <p>7.2 Global Finance Plus is not obliged to contact the client and advise upon appropriate
                                action reflecting changes in market conditions.</p>
                            <p>7.3 The client agrees to secure and hold Global Finance Plus, its affiliates, directors,
                                managers and employees harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
                                damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees that have arisen in connection with
                                Global Finance Plus&rsquo; services ,provided that any such liabilities, losses,
                                damages, costs and expenses have not arisen for Global Finance Plus&rsquo; gross
                                negligence, fraud or willful default.</p>
                            <p><strong>Prohibited Trading</strong></p>
                            <p>8.1 The client acknowledges and understands that the service provided by Global Finance
                                Plus to the client is not designed for specific trading techniques usually called
                                &ldquo;arbitrage trading&rdquo;, &ldquo;picking/sniping&rdquo;. Sniping: the situation
                                where the client is prematurely buying or selling near default prices.</p>
                            <p>In case that client is utilizing such techniques, the client agrees and acknowledges that
                                Global Finance Plus may take one or more, or any portion of, the following actions:</p>
                            <p>(i) close the client&rsquo;s account;</p>
                            <p>(ii) suspend the client&rsquo;s account for an undefined period of time;</p>
                            <p>(iii) carry out an investigation on the client&rsquo;s account for an indefinite period
                                of time;</p>
                            <p>(iv) charge a penalty fee to the client in the same or higher value of money which
                                resulted from the client employing such techniques.</p>
                            <p>The client shall not illegally access or attempt to gain access, reverse engineer or in
                                any other way bypass the security measures applied to the Trading Platform by Global
                                Finance Plus.</p>
                            <p>It is categorically prohibited to take any of the following actions:</p>

                            <p>Send any unrequested commercial communication that is not authorized.</p>
                            <p><strong>Untrue Trades</strong></p>
                            <p>9.1 HedgeStoneAssets.com Ltd. retains the right to cancel and/or reverse any trades which
                                are considered untrue or opened at a fictitious price not existing on the market at the
                                time of opening. Such cases include but are not limited to trades based on a non-market
                                quotation or based on latency trading (such as old prices).</p>
                            <p><strong>Islamic Accounts</strong></p>

                                application via email for such an account. Global Finance Plus is not obliged to provide
                                such an account and as such will look at each request on its individual merits. Clients
                                of Muslim faith will be solely eligible for opening an Islamic Account. In such account

                                commission fees with respect to ex-dividend payments for all Indices and Shares
                                instruments on any Islamic account for trades executed during ex-dividend dates.</p>
                            <p><strong>Trading Volume Limitation</strong></p>

                                has been placed on a client and that client attempts to exceed the volume limit on any

                            <p>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to
                                leverage. 72.54% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this
                                provider. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can
