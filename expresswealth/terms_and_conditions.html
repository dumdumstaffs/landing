                                    inducement to engage in any sort of investment activity. You agree and acknowledge
                                    that the tokens listed in Express Wealthdo not constitute shares or equities

                                <p>Crypto asset transactions made by you from your Express Wealthwallet are
                                    irreversible. If you send crypto assets to an incorrect address or send the wrong
                                    amount, you cannot retrieve it. Express Wealthwill not be liable for executing
                                    a transaction if the instruction relates to an incorrect crypto asset wallet
                                    address.</p>
                                <p>Before buying or selling crypto assets, you need to educate yourself about crypto
                                    investing as it entails risk and volatility and could result in the loss of your
                                    funds. You should ensure that you fully understand the risks involved and that you
                                    do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p>
                                <p>Crypto assets are not backed by an entity. Neither Crypto Coin Trade-Investment nor
                                    anyone else has an obligation to buy back the crypto assets in the future.</p>
                                <p>Crypto assets are not legal tender in most countries and are not issued, backed or
                                    guaranteed by any government.</p>
                                <p>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at domestic or international level may
                                    adversely affect the use, transfer, trading and value of crypto assets.</p>
                                <p>Because transactions on Express Wealthare generally irreversible, losses due to
                                    fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>
                                <p>Crypto asset transactions shall be deemed final when recorded on a blockchain ledger,
                                    which is not necessarily the same date or time that the transaction was initiated.
                                </p>
                                <p>There is no assurance that a person who accepts crypto assets as payment today will
                                    continue to do so in the future.</p>
                                <p>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of crypto relative to fiat currency
                                    may result in significant loss or tax liability over a short period of time.</p>
                                <p>Crypto assets are derived from the continued willingness of market participants to
                                    trading fiat currency for crypto, which may result in the potential for permanent
                                    and total loss of value.</p>
                                <p>The nature of crypto assets invites an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack.</p>
                                <p>You acknowledge that crypto asset investing involves risk and could result in
                                    financial losses. The performance of the investments contained or referred to in the
