<p>Hello, fellow innovators! I&#8217;m excited to find you here, but it isn&#8217;t just a happy accident. As the CEO of GiftPrime.ai, I believe in the power of inbound marketing and keyword research to naturally draw in and engage potential clients. As an audience member in today&#8217;s digital age, you are not just a passive recipient of information, but an active seeker, constantly looking for content that can solve your problems or answer your burning questions. As content creators and marketers, it&#8217;s our responsibility to ensure we create valuable, informative content that aligns with your needs and makes us discoverable on search engine result pages (<a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/serps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SERPs</a>).</p>



<p>So, if you aim to leverage content strategy for your business goals, it&#8217;s crucial to have a solid plan in place. Today, I&#8217;ll guide you on conducting keyword research, explain why it&#8217;s important, and reveal strategies to help your web pages rank high on SERPs.</p>



<p>Did you know that <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">68% of online experiences start with a search engine</a>? And a whopping 53% of all website traffic is generated through organic searches? This highlights the importance of identifying and incorporating the right keywords into your content strategy, which can prove to be more beneficial than any form of advertising.</p>



<p>Choosing the correct keywords can elevate your SEO strategy, leading to better SERP ranking and more traffic to your website. However, picking the wrong ones can lead to wasting significant resources and time. Fortunately, there are several easy steps to discover the right keywords for your business, and it starts with understanding keyword research.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Basics of Keyword Research</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail-1024x576.jpg" alt="Understanding the Basics of Keyword Research" class="wp-image-5722" srcset="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail-650x366.jpg 650w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Green-Professional-Crypto-YouTube-Thumbnail.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before we start, let&#8217;s familiarize ourselves with three crucial terms: seed keywords, head terms, and long-tail keywords.</p>



<p><strong>Seed Keywords</strong>: These are the core words and phrases that your potential customers might use when searching for what you have to offer. Consider these the &#8220;seeds&#8221; that will grow into a comprehensive keyword list.</p>



<p><strong>Head Term Keywords</strong>: These are shorter, more generic keywords with a high volume of monthly searches.</p>



<p><strong>Long-Tail Keywords</strong>: These are longer, more specific phrases that visitors are more likely to use when they&#8217;re closer to making a purchase decision.</p>



<p>An effective keyword strategy should start by putting yourself in the shoes of your target audience to determine your seed keywords. Once you&#8217;ve identified these, combine them with high-search volume head terms and specific long-tail keywords. This blend of keywords will allow you to create and optimize content targeting these queries.</p>



<p>Consider, for instance, <a href="https://gizzmo.ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GiftPrime.ai</a>. Our primary service revolves around AI-based automation for affiliate content. Therefore, the seed keywords that best represent our offerings might include phrases such as &#8220;AI affiliate content,&#8221; &#8220;content automation,&#8221; &#8220;AI for affiliate marketing,&#8221; and &#8220;automated affiliate content</p>



<p>By using a <a href="https://moz.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free keyword research tool</a>, you can find additional keyword ideas. Simply type your topic, choose your target country, and click find keywords. You&#8217;ll then see a list of relevant keyword suggestions.</p>



<p>Remember, seed keywords by themselves are broad ideas related to your website&#8217;s content. To better use them, you need to understand which ones should be targeted with informational blog articles, product pages, or category pages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing the Right Keywords for your Keyword Research</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail-1024x576.jpg" alt="Choosing the Right Keywords for your Keyword Research" class="wp-image-5723" srcset="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail-650x366.jpg 650w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colorful-Freelancer-YouTube-Thumbnail.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To select keywords worth targeting, consider the following factors:</p>



<p><strong>Informational Keywords</strong>: These keywords are used when someone wants to learn something related to your business or niche. Users do not have a buying intent, but you may have an opportunity to guide them towards your offerings subtly.</p>



<p><strong>Navigational Keywords</strong>: When someone types a brand or company name into a search engine, they use navigational keywords. These users already know what they want from your site and are trying to find a specific product or page.</p>



<p><strong>Commercial Keywords</strong>: These are keywords that reveal a searcher&#8217;s interest around specific products or services. Users looking to buy or educate themselves for future purchases use these searches.</p>



<p><strong>Transactional Keywords</strong>: When users are ready to make a purchase, they use transactional keywords. These keywords should reflect their buying intent and can be targeted with highly optimized purchase pages or pages where users can immediately act on your site.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Analyzing keywords by intent is undoubtedly the most important concept when it comes to keyword research. It helps you craft the right content to satisfy the goal behind a searcher&#8217;s query, delivering the most relevant results.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Analyzing Competitor Keywords</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26.png" alt="Analyzing Competitor Keywords for your Keyword Research" class="wp-image-5724" srcset="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26.png 1024w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26-300x300.png 300w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26-150x150.png 150w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26-768x768.png 768w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-26-650x650.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">little cute realistic dinosaur in an office analyzing data by Midjourney</figcaption></figure>



<p>Identifying search intent involves conducting a Google search using one of the seed keywords you aim to rank for. Then, analyze the top-ranking results to see which keywords are driving traffic to your competitors. By understanding the keywords used by successful competitors, you can gain a clearer picture of your industry&#8217;s keyword landscape.</p>



<p>After finding a competitor website that ranks high for your keywords, the next step is to check which pages bring in the most traffic and what keywords these pages are targeting.</p>



<p>For GiftPrime.ai, an in-depth competitive analysis might disclose that competitors are successfully ranking for phrases such as &#8220;AI affiliate content,&#8221; &#8220;automated affiliate marketing,&#8221; or &#8220;best AI for affiliate content.&#8221; By employing this data, we can optimize our content to incorporate these keywords, boosting our chances of achieving higher rankings on SERPs.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to use these insights to guide your SEO content strategy. Remember, though, having multiple pages about the same topic can lead to a phenomenon called keyword cannibalization, which can hurt your site&#8217;s overall organic performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keyword Cannibalization and How to Avoid It</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27.png" alt="Donut cannibalizing other donuts - by MidJourney " class="wp-image-5725" srcset="https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27.png 1024w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-300x300.png 300w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-150x150.png 150w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-768x768.png 768w, https://gizzmo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-27-650x650.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donut cannibalizing other donuts &#8211; by Midjourney </figcaption></figure>



<p>Keyword cannibalization happens when multiple pages on your site target the same keyword, causing them to compete against each other in SERPs.</p>



<p>To detect keyword cannibalization, perform a simple search of your most relevant keywords. If you see multiple pages from your site listed close together in search results for the same keyword, you have a cannibalization problem.</p>



<p>Resolving cannibalization issues often involves consolidating pages. This can mean redirecting an older page to something more relevant that you already have or combining multiple pages into something new.</p>



<p>Remember, the content you write on your website is directly linked to the keywords you want your website to rank for. Having access to specialized keyword research tools will only make your SEO content strategy stronger.</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, conducting effective keyword research is a vital part of a robust SEO strategy. It&#8217;s the bridge that connects you to your target audience, helping them find you amid the vast digital landscape. GiftPrime.ai believes in the power of data-driven decisions, and we hope this guide helps you drive more traffic, shares, and conversions.</p>
